Overview
The AI-Based Autograder is a prototype project designed to automate the grading of student code assignments using OpenAI's GPT-4 API. This tool evaluates code quality, correctness, and efficiency, providing detailed feedback to students in real time.

By leveraging the power of AI, the autograder streamlines the grading process, reduces manual effort, and ensures consistent evaluation, even for large classes.

Features
📋 Automated Code Evaluation – Grades submissions by analyzing structure, logic, and adherence to best practices.
🐛 Error Detection and Debugging – Identifies errors in student code and provides tailored suggestions for improvement.
📊 Structured Feedback – Generates detailed JSON output containing scores, feedback, and areas for improvement.
🔐 Secure & Private – Ensures code privacy with secure API calls and data handling protocols.
